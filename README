This thing needs CMake to configure, a Make-like program to compile, and the SDL
libraries to run, so make sure you have all of those...

To test this program out, cd into this directory, and run:

  cmake . && make && ./tunneltanks

To install, run:

  sudo make install

To return the project to it's pristine starting state, run:

  make dist-clean

That command may need to be run as root if you did a make install, since make
install also needs to be run as root and may leave a root-owned file in the
directory. You can blame CMake for this inconvenience...

Also, this project has some packaging targets, so try:

  "make package-tbz2" to make a binary tar.bz2,
  "make package-deb" to make a debian package file, and
  "make package-rpm" to make a RPM package file. (Requires rpmbuild.)

If you wish to compile the Android port of this project, then first make sure
that you have both the Android SDK and NDK downloaded, extracted into 
directories, and that the SDK's root directory and the NDK's "tools" directory
are both in the current $PATH. Then, cd into the android subdirectory and run
the build.sh script. That will compile everything needed, and assemble the
resulting debug apk's in the bin subdirectory.


So there you have it. If you make any neat modifications (ie: new level 
generator, new ai, bug fixes, etc...) feel free to email patches to me at:

Thanks, and have fun. :)
