This thing needs CMake to configure, a Make-like program to compile, and the SDL
libraries to run, so make sure you have all of those...

To test this program out, cd into this directory, and run:

  cmake . && make && ./tunneltanks

To install, run:

  sudo make install

To return the project to it's pristine starting state, run:

  make dist-clean

That command may need to be run as root if you did a make install, since make
install also needs to be run as root and may leave a root-owned file in the
directory. You can blame CMake for this inconvenience...

Also, this project has some packaging targets, so try:

  "make package-tbz2" to make a binary tar.bz2,
  "make package-deb" to make a debian package file, and
  "make package-rpm" to make a RPM package file. (Requires rpmbuild.)

Also, if you make any neat modifications (ie: new level generator, new ai, bug
fixes, etc...) feel free to mail patches to me at: 

  'ray [AT] poweredbytoast [DOT] com'

Thanks, and have fun. :)
