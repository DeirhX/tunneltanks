This thing needs a CMake to configure, GNU Make to compile, and the SDL libraries to run, so make sure you have all of those...

To test this thing out, cd into this directory, and run:

cmake . && make && ./src/tunneltanks

To return the project to it's pristine starting state, run:

./dist-clean.sh

If you make any neat modifications (new level generator, new ai, bug fixes, etc) feel free to mail patches to me: Raymond Myers at 'ray [at] poweredbytoast [dot] com'. A more elegant solution (ie, a code repository) will be coming soon...
