v?.?:
 - Abstracted all SDL code into a new folder called gamelib. This gamelib can
   have multiple implementations, making it easier to port the game to platforms
   without SDL.
 - Made it possible to pick either single, or two-player modes.
 - Converted to the Git VCS, for reasons.
 - Added support for an Android port.
 - Added a new level generator: "braid".
 - Added support for joystick controls.

v0.4:
 - Switched to a CMake/CPack-based build/packaging system, which can build
   binary tar.bz2's, deb's, and rpm's.
 - Improved Twitch's self-preservation instincts.
 - All code is now managed by the Bazaar VCS.
 - Changed digging behavior to be more like the original game.
 - Made it possible for there to be more than one level generator, and added 2
   new level generators: 'simple' and 'maze'. The original one is named 'toast'.
   Better name coming soon. :)
 - Added fullscreen capabilities.
 - Added a means for an AI to query the surrounding level.
 - With the '--large' CLA, you can have the level generators make even BIGGER
   maps. (1500x750 vs 1000x500)
 - Improved command-line parsing.
 - Other bugfixes.
